# Simple task list project

This project was created to demonstrate some JavaScript fundamentals, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and the use of localStorage.
The application is a simple task list where the user can type a task into an input field and add it to a list below. Each task can be removed by clicking the "Clear" button.
All tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage, allowing users to keep their task history even after reloading the page. Users can click the “Task History” button to display all saved tasks on the page and also delete the entire task history stored in localStorage.
