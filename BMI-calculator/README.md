# BMI calculator

This project was created to demonstrate some JavaScript fundamentals, such as DOM manipulation and event handling.
The application calculates the user's BMI based on their height and weight and displays a BMI table to help interpret the result.
A BMI table for children is also shown for informational purposes, since children's BMI depends on various external factors, such as age, sex, and growth charts.
