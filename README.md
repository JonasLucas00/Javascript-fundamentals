# JavaScript Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects created for practice and study purposes. The main goal is to strengthen the understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, programming logic, and common frontend concepts.

Each project is isolated in its own folder and focuses on specific topics such as DOM manipulation, events, browser storage, and basic application structure.
